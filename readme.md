Code to process and display data from the winter snow school 2018 at the col du Lautaret.

To plot Crocus and its forcing data use the scripts:
    - plot_crocus.py
    - lautaret_weather.py
    
Todo:
    - plot weather and snow evo on subplots with the same x-ais extent
    - plot snowpit simulated by crocus next to observation (cannot load caaml file at the moment). maybe simply do it in illustrator
    - Compare density from SWE tube, Micro pen, and pit. Have a boxplot for all three
